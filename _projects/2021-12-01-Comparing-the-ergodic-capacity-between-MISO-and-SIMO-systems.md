In this simulation, our aim is to compare the capacity of the MIMO system under different scenarios, by varying the number of transmitter and receiver antennas ($$N_r, N_t$$). We calculated the capacities for different values of $$N_r, N_t$$ and plot the results. This analysis has been conducted for both MISO and SIMO modes.

A function called ErgodicCapacity has been developed. This function takes inputs such as Niter (number of iterations), Nr (number of receiver antennas), Nt (number of transmitter antennas), and SNRdB (Signal-to-Noise Ratio in decibels). The output of the function is a vector containing the calculated capacities for each scenario.
