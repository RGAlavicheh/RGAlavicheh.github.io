I am currently pursuing a PhD at KU Leuven University, which is part of a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Project in collaboration with IS Wireless Company. I am interested in exploring the physical layer aspects of telecommunications. In 2023, I earned my M.Sc. in Communication Systems from IUST, following my 2019 B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at Sadra University. My primary interests and research focus revolve around MIMO and multiple antenna communication systems, Open RAN, Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB), aerial base stations, and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS).
