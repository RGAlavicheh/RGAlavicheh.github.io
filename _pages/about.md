I am Reza Ghasemi Alavicheh, a wireless communications researcher with a Master’s degree in Communication Systems from the Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), where I was part of the [MBNRG](https://www.mobilebroadband.ir/en/) research group. I also hold a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Sadra University. My main focus is on the physical layer of wireless systems.
